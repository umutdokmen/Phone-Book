We costruct a showInfo method to print personel information
In DataFirstTry method we used while loop , when boolean true , it works. Defined an selection variable which has integer value , defined nameAsked which has String type.

We used if control state to search person or phone number .When user enter 1 or 2 program works . We defined an PersonControl variable and used counter integer variable which starts from 0.We used 2 for loops inside if statement . Outer for loop represent person which we searc.Inside for loop represent length size . In the inside if loop means if personControl’s size varible which is in the phonebook equall to nameAsked variable which we search name of person , program will increase counter one , than program print which person we searched . We limited counter with one
When user select 2 , it means program will search a phone number.Program wants a number to search.After user enter number program hold it in the memory.We used two for loop to search number . Outer for loop controls size of Person info which is in the phonebook.If person control value smaller than PersonInfo size , program enter second for loop which is inside.Inside for loop control length of personControl . Length variable starts from 3 , until length 5 , for loop works . We used if control statement . It controls personControl length of Person info . If it is equal to nameAsked , it increased counter one . We print the number as counter which we search
